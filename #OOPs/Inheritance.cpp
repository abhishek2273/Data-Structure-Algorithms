/*
Inheritance is a principle in object-oriented programming where a new class, known as a child or subclass, is created based on an existing class, known as a parent or superclass. The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class, allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

In simple terms, inheritance is like a family tree. Just as children inherit characteristics from their parents, a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from its superclass. For example, if you have a class Vehicle with attributes like speed and color and methods like move(), you can create a subclass Car that inherits these attributes and methods. The Car class can also have additional attributes and methods specific to cars, like number_of_doors and honk(). This way, Car gets all the features of Vehicle without having to rewrite the common code.
